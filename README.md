## Board

Purely for personal utility a lot of drawing type apps just have too much going
on or require sign up and all this other dumb shit so I had to write my own
version, this is a port of an old project so it's p bad but kinda just does
what I need it to.

## Controls

`Tab` Cycles between Black and Eraser

`g` sets green `r` sets red

`Backspace` clears the screen

## Updates

Changed brush size.
